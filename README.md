This is my blog. My blog. My Blog. Yes, MY BLOG.

The `src` directory keeps the raw files  
The `docs` directory is used for serving the site 

_Why `docs`?_ 'Cause GitHub says so!  
Try serving github pages from a directory called `www`! You can't! Ha!  
This is Microsoft, after all... what do you expect them to do? _Make GitHub
open-source?_ Heh!
